In this project, I created a Gender Classification Model which I did train using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.

I did build a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify the gender using the fingerprints. For this task, I used a dataset that contains over 55000 images of fingerprints of each finger.
